To get it working, you have to run these in order:

For my environment i created a virtual environment using .venv and Python 3.9.6

I have not properly commented and tidied up the structure of the code yet. Will do soon, this is to upload just to show the progress i have made and if anyone would want to try using what has been made.

Retrieving file paths
1. retrievefiles_v2.py # Updating to work with the latest dataset structure

Run pose estimation
2. pose_tracking.py

Run Data Processing
3. data_processing.ipynb # include the data processing mechanisms I wanted to implement (creating angles and calcualting acceleration)

Run Fall Detection Model training
4. train_v2.py # Updated to use a different sequence creation mechanism, so that we don't have to turn off use_cudnn, use_bias and also so that it works more like how i envisioned it to work)

Converting annotated frames to videos
5. frame_to_video.py
