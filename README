To get it working, you have to run these in order:

If you want to run the pose estimation extraction from scratch you need the dataset file, request it from me (Garrich) and you 
need to come in person because the dataset is 140GB big so i need to give you the thumb drive.

For my environment i created a virtual environment using .venv and Python 3.9.6

I have not properly commented and tidied up the structure of the code yet. Will do soon, this is to upload just to show the progress i have made and if anyone would want to try using what has been made.

Retrieving file paths
1. retrievefiles_v2.py 

Run pose estimation
2. pose_tracking.py

Run Data Processing
3. data_processing.ipynb # include the data processing mechanisms I wanted to implement (creating angles and calcualting acceleration)

Run Fall Detection Model training
4. train_v2.py # Updated to use a different sequence creation mechanism, so that we don't have to turn off use_cudnn, use_bias and also so that it works more like how i envisioned it to work)

Converting annotated frames to videos
5. frame_to_video.py
