Real-Time Fall Detection:
Implement a real-time fall detection system using a webcam or IP camera. This would require modifying the pose_tracking.py script to continuously capture frames and process them for pose estimation.

Multimodal Data Fusion:
Incorporate additional data sources, such as accelerometer and gyroscope data from wearable devices, to enhance fall detection accuracy and provide context for the detected falls.

Visualization of Keypoints:
Add functionality to visualize keypoints detected on images in a separate window or save them as annotated images.

test model.py:
Creating a test model script (test_model.py) for the i42 Fall Detection system would involve developing a dedicated script to evaluate the performance of the trained model on unseen data. This script would load the trained model, process a set of test images or videos, and output predictions, including metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The benefits of implementing this test model script include the ability to systematically assess the model's performance, identify areas for improvement, and ensure that the model generalizes well to new data. Additionally, it would facilitate the debugging process by allowing you to verify that the model operates correctly after any updates or changes to the codebase. Overall, a well-structured test model script would enhance the robustness of the fall detection system, providing valuable insights into its effectiveness and reliability in real-world scenarios.


load model test data
pose estimation
data preproccesing rate of change of What data basically the machine gets more information? So what do you right now? How's that improvement? Because there's more data for the computer to learn, cuz then they'll be able to learn from the rate of change of the X and Y values. So maybe they can, like, learn that speed affects the thing also in terms of angles. Then maybe they can learn like this is the current angle that these joints are on when this angle basically represents a falling movement or something like that.

Be able to load the model and test it. We're different at all. So, no, test it so I can see whether it's like the same 91% accuracy you're in. But I want to see whether it's like working as intended. like, right now, I went to a table to load, like, because you have the model trained, right? And I want to be able to save that model because the model's already saved. Then I'll put that model. I mean, load that model, which has been saved, and then try and test it on a different data set and see the accuracy. Whether it's like working as intended but encountering issue right now.
